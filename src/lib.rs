//! Reimagining of my old Python-based CLI application for tracking show
//! progress and what to watch next.
//!
//! Still in the experimental stage. Users beware!

//!
//! ## Running ontv in read-only mode
//!
//! If you for some reason want to run ontv in read-only mode you can do that
//! with the `--test` switch. I personally use this during development to make
//! sure I don't accidentally save bad data to my local database.
//!
//! ```
//! $ RUST_LOG=ontv=debug ontv --test
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Importing history from trakt.tv
//!
//! You must run the application at least once, and go into `Settings` to
//! configure your themoviedb.com API key. Unfortunately I cannot help you with
//! this.
//!
//! Next you'll need to export your existing history it using [this very helpful
//! service by Darek Kay](https://darekkay.com/blog/trakt-tv-backup/).
//!
//! After you've unpacked the file, import the history by starting `ontv` like
//! this:
//!
//! ```
//! $ RUST_LOG=ontv=debug ontv --import-trakt-watched C:\Downloads\watched_shows.txt --import-missing
//! ```
//!
//! The process is incremental, so don't worry if you have to abort it. If any
//! episode already has a watch history it will simply skip over that episode.
//!
//! This will take a while, so go get a â˜•.
